# WUGAN: Generating Antimicrobial Peptides with Wasserstein U-Net GANs

![WUGAN Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with your project logo -->

A cutting-edge **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** framework for designing novel **antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)** with therapeutic potential. WUGAN combines **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** and a **U-Net discriminator** to generate biologically plausible peptide sequences.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

WUGAN addresses the critical need for **novel antimicrobial agents** by leveraging **deep generative models** to design peptides with potential therapeutic applications. Unlike traditional GANs, WUGAN employs a **U-Net-based discriminator** to evaluate sequences at both **global and local scales**, ensuring high-quality and biologically relevant outputs.

### Key Features:
âœ… **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)** for stable training
âœ… **U-Net discriminator** for multi-scale sequence evaluation
âœ… **CutMix augmentation** for robust training
âœ… **Computational validation** with JSD and AMP metrics

## ðŸ”¬ How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Input**: Curated dataset of known antimicrobial peptide sequences
- **Preprocessing**: Sequences are encoded and augmented using **CutMix** to create hybrid real/fake samples
- **Output**: Training-ready tensor representations of peptide sequences

### 2. Model Architecture

#### Generator
- Transforms random noise into AMP sequences
- Optimized to fool the U-Net discriminator

#### U-Net Discriminator (Key Innovation)
- **Global Branch**: Evaluates overall sequence authenticity (Wasserstein loss)
- **Local Branch**: Focuses on fine-grained patterns (e.g., amino acid motifs) via sequence-wise classification
- **Decoder Loss**: Ensures local consistency in generated sequences

### 3. Training Process
- **Adversarial Training**: Generator and discriminator compete in a minimax game
- **Loss Functions**:
  - Wasserstein Loss: Measures distribution distance
  - Gradient Penalty: Enforces Lipschitz continuity
  - Decoder Loss: Ensures local sequence consistency
- **Stable Training**: WGAN-GP avoids mode collapse and vanishing gradients

### 4. Generation & Validation
- **Output**: Novel AMP sequences with potential antimicrobial activity
- **Validation**:
  - Computational metrics (JSD, AMP scores)
